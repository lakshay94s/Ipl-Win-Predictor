## Introduction

The IPL Projects repository includes two main projects:

1. **IPL Win Predictor**: Predicts the outcome of IPL matches using various machine learning models.
2. **IPL Recommender System**: Provides recommendations for IPL matches based on historical data.

## Projects

### IPL Win Predictor

The IPL Win Predictor uses historical match data to predict the outcome of future matches. It employs various machine learning models to achieve this, providing insights and predictions for IPL matches.

#### Models

The project explores various machine learning models, including:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree Classifier

#### Evaluation

The models are evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

### IPL Recommender System

The IPL Recommender System uses historical match data to provide recommendations for IPL matches. It preprocesses the data and applies various techniques to recommend matches based on user preferences.

#### Data Preprocessing

The notebook includes steps to preprocess the data, such as:
- Mapping team names
- Handling missing values
- Data cleaning and transformation

## Datasets

Both projects use the following datasets:
- `matches.csv`: Contains data about IPL matches.
- `deliveries.csv`: Contains ball-by-ball data of IPL matches.

## Installation

To use these projects, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IPL-Projects.git
cd IPL-Projects
pip install -r requirements.txt
